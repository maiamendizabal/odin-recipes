    <h2>
      I've tried many different ways to make a great, easy, hard-boiled egg with
      a soft white and a nice fluffy yolk that's not grey on the outside. After
      lots of trial and error, I've finally done it. After cooking I usually
      keep them in the shell until I need them. Enjoy!
